### To test your function, simply run `npm run test`. Test should rerun automatically

### Problem Solution - Code Review Process 
***step1***: Make sure to fork the repo before start working on a problem and create a `feature branch` for each problem only. 

***step2***: Tag your name in the comment for your solution like below: 

```javascript
  // Bill Ma
  const solutionToProblem = () => {
    // solution implementation ...
  }
```
***step3***: Run `npm run test` to make sure your solution works.

***step4***: create a pull request to `master branch` with your solution and assign a reviewer (note: if someone has already worked on the problem, pick that person as the reviewer, otherwise just randomly pick a person to review your solution)

***step5***: once your solution has been reviewed and merged to master, the previous solution will be overridden and the next person who works on the same problem will know to assign you as the reviewer for this problem.
