### To test your function, simply run `npm run test`. Test should rerun automatically

### Problem Solution - Code Review Process
***step1***: Make sure to fork the repo before start working on a problem and create a `feature branch` for each problem only.

***step2***: Create a file under the solutions folder using the issue number as the name. Ex: 1.js, 2.js, and so on.
If a file already exists, simply add your solution at the top of the file. Do not remove any previous solutions.


***step3***: Tag your name in the comment for your solution like below:

```javascript
  // Bill Ma
  const solutionToProblem = () => {
    // solution implementation ...
  }
```
***step4***: Run `npm run test` to make sure your solution works.

***step5***: create a pull request to `master branch` with your solution and assign a reviewer (note: if someone has already worked on the problem, pick that person as the reviewer, otherwise just randomly pick a person to review your solution)

***step6***: once your solution has been reviewed and merged to master, the next person who works on the same problem will know to assign you as the reviewer for this problem.
